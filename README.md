# Student-Information-System
Senior year class project which inplements an institution website (National Institute of Technology, Durgapur) for all the students to enroll in the database, check for their routine and also upload their cv for internship and job applications.
The images used in the project have been uploaded.
The front-end HTML5 and CSS3 codes have been used to makek the web pages.
The back-end PHP codes link the web pages to our database used which was WAMP server.
Create another database student which contains all of the student details, i.e. active users, rejectedusers, students(those people whose registration request approval is pending). In the sql file , student.sql, you have the details of the queries you need to run but you need not run the "insert into table" queries, just creation of database and creation of tables will suffice, insertion into table students can automatically be performed while registering through portal and approval of request from admin's side will move the entry to activeusers and rejection will move it to rejected users.
Keep all these files in the www subfolder of the wamp folder and create a folder inside www called 'pictures' where basically the profile pictures of the students will be moved to while uploading. Code for edit profile is in "editprofile.php" and "update.php" 
create a database register which contains a table called users. Users has the admin info, the details and the queries(including the insert into table queries) you need to run in your PHP MYADMIN ,is in the file users.sql.
